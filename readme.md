# 30 days of Elm

Start date: December 17th 2020

Each repo has a readme file, but I recommend checking out the comments here: [30 days of Elm @ dev.to](https://dev.to/kristianpedersen/30-days-of-elm-intro-2lo2)

## About this challenge
Hi! My name is Kristian. 

The next 30 days, I'm going to teach myself the basics of Elm.

My goal is to make something new every day with Elm. Even the simplest things count.

## Background

I've been writing JavaScript on and off since 2016, and I started learning React in November 2020.

JavaScript and React are great tools, but after my last few projects, I want to spend more time thinking about the problem at hand, and less time on runtime errors.

In the hands of more skilled developers, most of the errors I've gotten wouldn't have happened, or they would have been fixed much faster than I did, but I want to avoid them altogether.

## Why Elm?

Elm avoids runtime errors by design. Its error messages are really well written, its ecosystem seems cohesive, and I keep hearing good things about functional programming in general. 

Even if I don't end up continuing with Elm, I think this will be a fun and educational experience.
