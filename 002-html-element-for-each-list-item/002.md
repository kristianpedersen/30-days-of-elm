# 2/30: One paragraph tag for each person



Yesterday's post was a great experience! Check out the helpful comments I got!

Today's project is about looping through an array and showing each array item in a p tag.

Just like yesterday, the Elm code will not be nearly as easy to understand as its Svelte equivalent, but this should be fun!

```javascript
<script>
	let people = ["You", "Me", "They"];
</script>

{#each people as person}
	<p>{person}</p>
{/each}
```
